================

**A work in progress. Pushing this repo throughout the week!**

One week, one terrible game. Presented at Beer o'clock

You're Jackie Chain. You're freakin' awesome, and you're stuck inside a lively
casino full of dudes who for some ridiculous reason want to hurt your awesome self.

But guess what? You won't take that. Let's do it Rumble in the Bronx style and
get these guys out of our way. Throw them into slot machines, over tables, into
fountains. You'll be surprised to see that doing so yields so .. musical
enjoyment.

Run

There is no game yet, but if you're obviously curious you can just do:

    $ moonc ./casino-orchestra

Then run the game using Love2d

    $ love ./casino-orchestra

Thanks

[leafo](https://github.com/leafo) for creating Moonscript, and for open sourcing
all his games in it. An invaluable resource in helping me structure this and use some
existing utilities from lovekit.
