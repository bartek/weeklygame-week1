G Game Jam - Jackie Chan's Casino Orchestra
================

One week, one terrible game. Presented at Beer o'clock

Week over. Learnings
---

The week ended sooner than I had hoped for, but I learned alot about Moonscript and Love2d! I always had a hard time
grasping some of the syntax within Lua, but Moonscript puts zome Python-style zen into the code. I found it interesting
that Luas *only* data structure is tables, and all concept of lists, sets, etc. are represented solely by these.
I will need to better learn how to use these.

Otherwise, the game ended up being a tech demo, in where baddies spawn on a screen and you can collide with them, and 
hit them in the opportun moment. I now start next week, so look for weeklygame-week2!

You're Jackie Chain. You're freakin' awesome, and you're stuck inside a lively
casino full of dudes who for some ridiculous reason want to hurt your awesome self.

But guess what? You won't take that. Let's do it Rumble in the Bronx style and
get these guys out of our way. Throw them into slot machines, over tables, into
fountains. You'll be surprised to see that doing so yields.. musical
enjoyment.

Run

There is no game yet, but if you're obviously curious you can just do:

    $ moonc ./weeklygame-week1

Then run the game using Love2d

    $ love ./weeklygame-week1

Thanks

[leafo](https://github.com/leafo) for creating Moonscript, and for open sourcing
all his games in it. An invaluable resource in helping me structure this and use some
existing utilities from lovekit.
